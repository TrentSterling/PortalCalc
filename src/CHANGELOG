v1.1.0
- Added portal scanning
    * Includes block count to other portal (direction is coming... direction was too buggy for release).
    * Scans 20 blocks above and below (Y-axis) player
        • This can be overridden by using "/pc -s (height)". Height has to be less than or equal to 30.
- Console logs portal scans (in case a user is repeatedly scanning a region)

v1.0.1
- Changed "/pcalc" and "/pc" to return player's other world's location,
  rather than show help
